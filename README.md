# django_react_1
django+react project

Followed this tutorial here : 

https://dev.to/nagatodev/how-to-connect-django-to-reactjs-1a71

My aim with this project is to gain knowledge of how I can connect Django and ReactJS 

I used different names for folders and files than the tutorial since 
I aim to expand upon the initial layout to build a bigger application, possibly a dashboard.

I also connected to a PostgreSQL database instead, as that is the kind of database I will use.
